### Code Integration in HydroGuard ESP32 Pump Controller

The JSN-SR04T is integrated into the HydroGuard ESP32 Pump Controller as the `livello_cisterna` sensor, which measures water levels. Below are the details:

#### Code Configuration:

##### Pin Definitions:
```cpp
#define AJSR04M_TRIGGER_PIN 27
#define AJSR04M_ECHO_PIN 26
```

##### AJSR04M Structure:
```cpp
struct AJSR04M {
    int read_period; //[ms]
    int previous_read_time; //[ms]
    bool new_data;
    const uint8_t TRIG_PIN;
    const uint8_t ECHO_PIN;
    const float sound_speed;
    int read_repetitions;
    long duration;
    float distance; // [cm]
};
```

##### Initialization:
The sensor is initialized with specific properties:
```cpp
AJSR04M livello_cisterna = {5000, 0, 0, AJSR04M_TRIGGER_PIN, AJSR04M_ECHO_PIN, SOUND_SPEED, 1, 0, 0};
```

##### Trigger and Measurement Functions:
- **Trigger Function:**
  ```cpp
  void triggerAJSR04M(uint8_t trigPin) {
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(2);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(10);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  }
  ```
- **Measurement Function:**
  ```cpp
  long measureAJSR04M(uint8_t trigPin, uint8_t echoPin) {
      long duration_mean = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < livello_cisterna.read_repetitions; i++) {
          vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000)); // Wait at least 1 second
          triggerAJSR04M(trigPin);
          long duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
          duration_mean += duration;
      }
      return duration_mean / livello_cisterna.read_repetitions;
  }
  ```

##### Pin Mode Configuration:
```cpp
pinMode(livello_cisterna.TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
pinMode(livello_cisterna.ECHO_PIN, INPUT_PULLDOWN);
```

#### Potential Considerations:
- The `INPUT_PULLDOWN` setting for the `ECHO_PIN` might not be suitable, as the JSN-SR04T sensor typically does not require an internal pull resistor. Verify the sensor's datasheet for electrical requirements.
- Ensure proper power supply levels. The sensor operates at 5V, while the ESP32 logic typically uses 3.3V. A level shifter might be required.

### Troubleshooting
If the sensor does not provide accurate readings:
1. Verify the wiring and ensure solid connections.
2. Check compatibility of voltage levels between the sensor and the ESP32.
3. Review the software implementation for timing or pin configuration mismatches.
4. Ensure the sensor is not placed within its blind zone (25 cm).
